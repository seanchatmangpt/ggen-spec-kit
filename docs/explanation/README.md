## 🚀 Deep Dives

Explore each concept in detail:

### The Constitutional Equation

The core principle of Spec Kit is the constitutional equation:

```
spec.md = μ(feature.ttl)
```

This means specifications (written in RDF) transform into documentation and code. Learn why this matters:

→ [Constitutional Equation](./constitutional-equation.md)

### RDF-First Paradigm

Unlike traditional development, Spec Kit puts RDF specifications first. This changes everything:

→ [RDF-First Development](./rdf-first-development.md)

### Three-Tier Architecture

Code is organized into three layers for clarity and testability:

→ [Three-Tier Architecture](./three-tier-architecture.md)

### Jobs-to-be-Done

Instead of building features, we build solutions to user "jobs":

→ [Why JTBD Framework?](./why-jtbd-framework.md)

## 💭 Philosophical Questions

These explanations address deep questions:

- **Why RDF?** Because it's machine-readable and semantically rich
- **Why specs first?** Because specifications are the source of truth
- **Why three tiers?** Because separation of concerns enables testing and clarity
- **Why JTBD?** Because users have jobs to accomplish, not features to use
- **Why observability?** Because visibility enables understanding and improvement
