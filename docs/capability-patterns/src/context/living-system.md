# 1. Living System

★★

*Every capability exists within a larger system of people, tools, processes, and purposes. Before you can create a capability that serves well, you must understand the living system it will join.*

---

You are about to build something new. Perhaps a command, an API, a service, or a tool. You have ideas about what it should do. But stop.

The capability you create will not exist in isolation. It will join a living system—a web of human activities, existing tools, organizational processes, and cultural habits. If you build without understanding this system, your capability will feel foreign, awkward, intrusive. It will be used grudgingly or not at all.

**The problem: Capabilities built in isolation from their context feel alien to the people and systems they're meant to serve.**

---

**The forces at play:**

- *Urgency pulls toward building quickly.* Stakeholders want features. Deadlines loom. The pressure is always to start coding.

- *Complexity resists comprehension.* Real systems are messy. People have workarounds, unwritten rules, invisible dependencies. Understanding takes time.

- *Ego tempts toward reinvention.* We believe we can make something better than what exists. But "better" in isolation may be "worse" in context.

- *Existing patterns carry momentum.* People have habits. Tools have integrations. Processes have inertia. Fighting this momentum exhausts everyone.

These forces create a tension: you want to build something valuable, but building without understanding the living system produces something that doesn't fit.

---

**Therefore:**

Before designing any capability, map the living system it will inhabit. Understand:

1. **The people** — Who will use this capability? Who will be affected by it? What are their roles, skills, and time pressures?

2. **The existing tools** — What tools already exist? How do people use them? What integrations matter? What would break if removed?

3. **The processes** — How does work flow? What are the formal processes? What are the informal workarounds?

4. **The culture** — What values guide decisions? What's celebrated? What's tolerated? What's rejected?

5. **The boundaries** — Where does this system end? What external systems does it interact with? What are the integration points?

Do not rely solely on documentation or interviews. *Observe*. Watch people work. Use the existing tools yourself. Feel the friction points. Experience the flow.

Create a map—not just a diagram, but a rich understanding of how the system *lives*. This map becomes the context for all design decisions that follow.

---

**Resulting context:**

After applying this pattern, you have:

- A holistic view of the system your capability will join
- Understanding of the people who will use it
- Knowledge of existing tools and their integration points
- Insight into formal processes and informal workarounds
- Appreciation for the culture that will receive your work

This context shapes everything that follows. The **[Customer Job](./customer-job.md)** you identify will be grounded in reality. The **[Forces in Tension](./forces-in-tension.md)** you discover will be real forces, not imagined ones. The capability you build will feel like it belongs.

---

**Related patterns:**

- *This pattern sets the stage for:* **[2. Customer Job](./customer-job.md)** — Understanding the system helps you identify what progress people actually need
- *This pattern supports:* **[3. Forces in Tension](./forces-in-tension.md)** — Real forces emerge from understanding the living system
- *This pattern enables:* **[8. Competing Solutions](./competing-solutions.md)** — You can only evaluate alternatives when you understand the current system

A capability is not just code. It is a participant in a living system. Treat it as such.
