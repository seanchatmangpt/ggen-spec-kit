# Glossary

Key terms used throughout this pattern language.

---

## A

**Acceptance Criterion**
: A specific, testable condition that must be satisfied for a capability to be considered complete. Typically expressed in Given-When-Then format.

**Anxiety**
: Fear or uncertainty that creates resistance to adopting new solutions. Part of the forces that hold people back from making progress.

**Artifact**
: Any output generated by the transformation pipeline—code files, documentation, configuration, tests.

---

## B

**Branching Exploration**
: The practice of generating multiple implementation variants from the same specification to compare approaches.

---

## C

**Canonicalization**
: The fourth stage (μ₄) of the transformation pipeline that normalizes output format—line endings, whitespace, encoding.

**Circumstance**
: The specific situation in which a customer job arises. Includes trigger, emotional state, time budget, and consequences.

**Competing Solution**
: Any alternative way customers might address their job, including other tools, manual processes, or doing nothing.

**Constitutional Equation**
: The fundamental principle of specification-driven development: `spec.md = μ(feature.ttl)`. Human-readable artifacts are generated from formal specifications.

**Contract Test**
: A test that verifies interface promises without testing internal implementation.

**Customer Job**
: The progress a person is trying to make in a specific circumstance. Includes functional, emotional, and social dimensions.

---

## D

**Deprecation Path**
: A structured approach to retiring capabilities that includes warnings, alternatives, timelines, and clean removal.

**Domain-Specific Language (DSL)**
: A simplified syntax or pattern that makes common specification tasks easier while remaining valid RDF.

**Drift**
: Divergence between source specification and generated artifact, typically caused by manual editing of generated files.

---

## E

**Executable Specification**
: A specification precise enough to drive validation, generation, and testing—not just describe intent.

**Extraction Query**
: A SPARQL query (μ₂) that pulls structured data from RDF for template rendering.

---

## F

**Feedback Loop**
: The connection between production reality and specification evolution, enabling continuous improvement.

**Forces**
: The tensions that make problems difficult—often pulling in different directions (e.g., speed vs. thoroughness).

---

## G

**Gap Analysis**
: The process of comparing current performance against targets to identify improvement opportunities.

**ggen**
: The transformation tool that implements the μ pipeline, converting RDF specifications to artifacts.

---

## H

**Habit**
: An established pattern of behavior that creates inertia against change.

**Human-Readable Artifact**
: Generated output designed for human consumption—clear structure, helpful comments, consistent formatting.

---

## I

**Idempotent Transform**
: A transformation where running it twice produces the same result as running it once (μ ∘ μ = μ).

**Inference Rule**
: A rule that derives new facts from existing ones, keeping specifications DRY.

**Integration Reality**
: Testing with real dependencies rather than mocks.

---

## J

**JTBD (Jobs To Be Done)**
: A framework focused on understanding the progress customers are trying to make, not just features they request.

---

## L

**Layered Ontology**
: Organization of concepts by abstraction level—universal, framework, domain, instance.

**Living Documentation**
: Documentation generated from specifications that updates automatically when specifications change.

**Living System**
: The interconnected web of people, tools, processes, and culture that a capability joins.

---

## M

**μ (mu)**
: The transformation function in the constitutional equation. Consists of five stages: normalize, extract, emit, canonicalize, receipt.

**Multi-Target Emission**
: Generating multiple output formats from a single specification.

---

## N

**Narrative Specification**
: Human context (rationale, scenarios, alternatives) embedded in formal specifications.

**Normalization Stage**
: The first stage (μ₁) of transformation that validates source against SHACL shapes.

---

## O

**Observable Execution**
: Instrumentation of capabilities with telemetry—traces, metrics, logs—for understanding and debugging.

**Ontology**
: A formal specification of concepts, relationships, and constraints in a domain.

**Outcome**
: The measurable result customers seek from making progress on a job. Direction (minimize/maximize) + metric + object.

**OWL**
: Web Ontology Language. Used for defining class hierarchies and property characteristics.

---

## P

**Partial Regeneration**
: Transforming only the artifacts affected by a change, rather than everything.

**Pattern**
: A recurring solution to a problem in a context, with explicit forces and trade-offs.

**Pattern Language**
: A network of interconnected patterns that form a generative grammar for creating things.

**Progress Maker**
: Anything that helps customers make progress on their jobs—tools, processes, workarounds.

**Property Path**
: SPARQL syntax for navigating multi-hop relationships in RDF graphs.

---

## R

**RDF (Resource Description Framework)**
: A semantic web standard for representing knowledge as subject-predicate-object triples.

**RDFS**
: RDF Schema. Provides vocabulary for class and property definitions.

**Receipt**
: Cryptographic proof that an artifact was correctly generated from its source specification.

---

## S

**Semantic Foundation**
: The formal language (RDF) chosen for representing specifications.

**SHACL**
: Shapes Constraint Language. Used for validating RDF data against shape definitions.

**Shape Constraint**
: A formal definition of valid specification structure using SHACL.

**Single Source of Truth**
: One authoritative location for each piece of knowledge, eliminating drift.

**SPARQL**
: Query language for RDF data.

**Specification Refinement**
: The disciplined practice of improving specifications based on feedback while maintaining consistency.

---

## T

**Template Emission**
: The third stage (μ₃) of transformation that renders templates with extracted data.

**Test Before Code**
: Writing tests (generated from specifications) before implementation.

**Traceability Thread**
: Explicit links connecting related artifacts across all levels—from jobs to outcomes to criteria to tests to code.

**Triple**
: The basic unit of RDF: subject, predicate, object.

**Turtle**
: A human-readable serialization format for RDF.

---

## V

**Verification Pattern**
: A pattern focused on ensuring correctness—testing, validation, drift detection.

**Vocabulary Boundary**
: Namespace separation that keeps domain concepts distinct.

---

## Symbols

**★**
: One-star confidence. Pattern is promising but less empirically validated.

**★★**
: Two-star confidence. Pattern is well-established with substantial evidence of success.

**→**
: "Sets context for" or "enables"

**↔**
: "Completed by" or "works together with"

**⊢**
: "Verified by"
