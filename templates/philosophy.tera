# Specification-Driven Development (SDD) Philosophy

Specification-Driven Development is a methodology where specifications are the source of truth and deterministically drive code generation. This document outlines the core principles and philosophy that guide the Spec-Kit project.

## Constitutional Equation

```
specification.md = μ(feature.ttl)
```

This equation expresses the core principle of SDD: specifications in Markdown are generated artifacts of specifications in Turtle RDF format. The function μ represents the deterministic transformation pipeline.

## Implementation Across Spec-Kit

The principles above are not merely theoretical - they are actively implemented and enforced throughout the Spec-Kit project:

- **Ontology-First Design**: The `ontology/spec-kit-schema.ttl` file encodes the domain model before any code is written
- **Deterministic Transformation**: The `ggen v6` pipeline ensures reproducible specifications → implementation mappings
- **Validation as Code**: SHACL shapes in the ontology validate specification quality upfront
- **Source of Truth**: All documentation, specifications, and configurations derive from RDF Turtle files
- **Idempotent Operations**: Running transformations multiple times produces identical results

## Benefits of SDD

1. **Reduced Ambiguity**: Specifications are machine-readable and validated before implementation
2. **Automation**: Code generation reduces manual effort and human error
3. **Traceability**: Complete audit trail from requirements to implementation
4. **Maintainability**: Changes to specifications automatically propagate to generated code
5. **Quality Assurance**: SHACL validation catches specification errors early
6. **Reproducibility**: Same specification always generates same implementation

## Relationship to Other Methodologies

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: SDD is complementary - specifications define tests and behavior
- **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: The ontology embodies domain knowledge and ubiquitous language
- **Model-Driven Engineering (MDE)**: RDF/OWL models are the primary artifacts, not visualizations

## Getting Started with SDD

See the [RDF Workflow Guide](RDF_WORKFLOW_GUIDE.md) for step-by-step instructions on implementing SDD with Spec-Kit.
