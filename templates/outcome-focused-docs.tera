## Why This Feature Exists

Every feature exists to help you accomplish a specific job. Here's what {{ featureName }} does for you:

### The Job

**As a {{ personaName }}**, you need to {{ jobTitle }}.

### The Problem

Currently, you experience: **{{ painpoint }}**

### The Solution

{{ featureName }} helps you {{ outcome }}.

**Measurable Impact**: {{ outcomeMetric }} - {{ successCriteria }} {{ targetValue }}

## Who This Is For

**Primary Persona**: {{ personaName }}

**When to Use This**: When you need to {{ jobTitle | lower }} and want to {{ outcome | lower }}.

## How It Improves Your Outcomes

Using {{ featureName }}, you will:

1. **Stop experiencing**: {{ painpoint }}
2. **Start achieving**: {{ outcome }}
3. **Measure success by**: {{ successCriteria }} (target: {{ targetValue }})

## Usage

{% if prerequisites %}
### Prerequisites

{{ prerequisites }}

{% endif %}
### Example

```
{{ usageExample | default(value="# Usage example coming soon") }}
```

### What Happens

{{ featureDescription }}

## Success Metrics to Track

Monitor these metrics to ensure {{ featureName }} delivers value:

| Metric | Target | How to Measure |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| {{ outcomeMetric }} | {{ targetValue }} | {{ successCriteria }} |

## Related Features

{% if relatedFeatures %}
Other features that help with "{{ jobTitle }}":

{% set features = relatedFeatures | split(pat="|") %}
{% for feature in features %}
- **{{ feature }}**: Addresses the same job from a different angle
{% endfor %}

Consider using these together for maximum impact.
{% else %}
{{ featureName }} is the primary feature for this job.
{% endif %}

## Getting Help

If {{ featureName }} doesn't help you {{ outcome | lower }}, or you still experience {{ painpoint }}:

1. Check the [troubleshooting guide](troubleshooting.md)
2. Review success metrics above
3. File an issue describing what outcome you need

Remember: Features exist to deliver outcomes. If this feature doesn't deliver your outcome, that's a product gap we want to fix.
