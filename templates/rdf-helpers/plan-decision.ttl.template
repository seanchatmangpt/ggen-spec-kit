# EXAMPLES:
# :decision-001 a sk:PlanDecision ;
#     sk:decisionId "DEC-001" ;
#     sk:decisionTitle "RDF Store Selection" ;
#     sk:decisionChoice "Oxigraph embedded store" ;
#     sk:decisionRationale "Zero external dependencies, fast startup, sufficient for <1M triples, Rust native" ;
#     sk:alternativesConsidered "Apache Jena (JVM overhead), Blazegraph (deprecated), GraphDB (commercial)" ;
#     sk:tradeoffs "Gain: simplicity, speed. Lose: scalability beyond 1M triples, no SPARQL federation" ;
#     sk:revisitCriteria "Dataset grows beyond 500K triples or requires distributed queries" .
