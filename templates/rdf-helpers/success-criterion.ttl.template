# Success Criterion Instance (Measurable)
:sc-NNN a sk:SuccessCriterion ;
    sk:criterionId "SC-NNN" ;  # MUST match pattern: ^SC-[0-9]{3}$ (SHACL validated)
    sk:description "DESCRIPTION of what success looks like" ;
    sk:measurable true ;  # Boolean: true or false
    sk:metric "METRIC NAME - What is being measured" ;  # Required if measurable=true
    sk:target "TARGET VALUE - The goal or threshold (e.g., < 30 seconds, >= 90%)" .  # Required if measurable=true

# Success Criterion Instance (Non-Measurable)
:sc-NNN a sk:SuccessCriterion ;
    sk:criterionId "SC-NNN" ;
    sk:description "QUALITATIVE DESCRIPTION of success" ;
    sk:measurable false .  # No metric/target needed

# EXAMPLES:
# :sc-001 a sk:SuccessCriterion ;
#     sk:criterionId "SC-001" ;
#     sk:measurable true ;
#     sk:metric "Time to create album and add photos" ;
#     sk:target "< 30 seconds for 10 photos" ;
#     sk:description "Users can create an album and add 10 photos in under 30 seconds" .
#
# :sc-002 a sk:SuccessCriterion ;
#     sk:criterionId "SC-002" ;
#     sk:measurable true ;
#     sk:metric "Task completion rate" ;
#     sk:target ">= 90%" ;
#     sk:description "90% of users successfully organize photos into albums without assistance on first attempt" .

# VALIDATION RULES (enforced by SHACL):
# - criterionId MUST match pattern: SC-001, SC-002, etc. (not C-001, SUCCESS-1)
# - description is required
# - measurable is required (boolean)
# - If measurable=true, metric and target are recommended
